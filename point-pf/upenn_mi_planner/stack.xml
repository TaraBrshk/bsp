	This stack contains an implementation of algorithms in "Cooperative
	Multi-Robot Estimation and Control for Radio Source Localization" by Ben
	Charrow, Nathan Michael and Vijay Kumar.  Specifically, it has code for a
	particle filter, LOS/NLOS classification of range measurements, and a
	mutual information planner.

	To actually move the robots, the code uses a ROS wrapper of the RVO library
	which is available at https://github.com/bcharrow/rvo
