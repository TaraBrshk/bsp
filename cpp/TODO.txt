- Setup light dark example in C++ 
  -- setup belief dynamics with covariance matrix inside the state -- DONE
  -- verify belief trajectory and cost -- DONE
  -- visualization in callisto -- DONE

- Integrate FORCES solver generated code in C++ implementation
  -- covariance matrix inside the state and linearized constraint for belief dynamics, verify implementation against Matlab -- DONE

- Factor out covariance matrix from the state 
  -- FORCES code gen
  -- Integrate D* code to compute cost, Jacobians, Diagonal Hessian term for separable objective
  -- Diagonal Hessian or block diagonal Hessian?
  -- verify correctness of implementation

- Scaling experiments to verify if speed up is obtained
  -- increase number of timesteps, dimension of state
