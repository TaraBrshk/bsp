	C++ implementation of an approximation algorithm for calculating the
	entropy of a Gaussian Mixutre model.  Code based on the paper:
	@inproceedings{Huber2008On-entropy,
        Author = {Marco F. Huber and Tim Bailey and Hugh Durrant-Whyte and Uwe D. Hanebeck},
		Booktitle = {Multisensor Fusion and Integration for Intelligent Systems},
		Organization = {IEEE},
		Pages = {181--188},
		Title = {On Entropy Approximation for Gaussian Mixture Random Vectors},
		Year = {2008}}
	
	Errors in the paper:
	1) In "Example 1 (Derivatives of a Gaussian)" The gradient of g(x) with
	respect to x is missing a minus sign.  The phrase "employing
	\partial/\partial\mu" just before this equation seems irrelevant as the
	gradient is with respect to x and not the mean.  Similarly, the first term
	in equation (6) should be -C^{-1} (x-mu) (grad(x))^T
	
	2) In section VI.A the equation "e = y - \tilde{y}" appears.  It should be
	"e = x - \tilde{y}".
